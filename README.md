# OneGlobe
### What is OneGlobe?

In the modern era, the world feels smaller than ever.  Anyone can find the information they are looking for with a few taps on their phone or clicks on their computer.  You can view resource after resource about any destination anywhere on the globe!  But, at OneGlobe we believe there is no substitute for real human interaction.  That's why we are committed to bridging differences between people in order to make the world feel a little bit safer for everyone. We hope to bring people together as users explore and make exciting discoveries all over the world.  OneGlobe is more than a tourism service, and it is more than a social media platform; OneGlobe is a mechanism for real social change all over the world.
